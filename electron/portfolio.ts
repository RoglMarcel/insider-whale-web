 * Testing portfolio — I/O side (v1.4.0).

 * The RULES live in `src/lib/portfolio-rules.ts` and are pure; this module only
 * feeds them: pull candidate signals out of SQLite, make sure the adjusted-close
 * cache covers the window, run the simulation, persist the result.
 *
 * Two invariants are enforced here rather than in the rules:
 *  - SETTLED days are APPEND-ONLY. A settled day that has been written is never
 *    rewritten, so a later price restatement cannot retroactively move a point
 *    somebody has already looked at. Drift is counted and reported, not silently
 *    applied. Two things are deliberately NOT covered by that rule, because
 *    applying it to them produced a curve that contradicted itself (see the
 *    comment in `runSync`): the newest day, which is provisional intraday data,
 *    and the whole curve when the config changes, which makes the stored rows a
 *    different strategy rather than older history of this one.
 *  - SPY is mandatory. A curve without its benchmark is worthless, so a run that
 *    cannot resolve SPY writes nothing at all.
